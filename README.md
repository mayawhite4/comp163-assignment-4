# What is the game about
This game allows you to input your current states. It then allows you to choose your course load and make a decision on what course you want to study. At the end it gives you your final stats and allows you to pcik something to do during the break inbetween semsesters

# What branching concepts are demonstrated 
The branches if, else and elif are key concepts in my code. I use them to output a response depending on the users input. Within the if, else and elif branches are nested if statements used to make decisions on more precise data. 

# How to run the game
First you start with inputting your stats into the game. The you choose your course load which effecst your study time and your stress level based on your gpa.
After you chose your course load you choose which course you would liek to study which effects your gpa and your social time. Lastly your final stats are displayed and you are able to choose a activity based on the final stats. Such as your gpa, social time and stress levels. 

# What the different endings represent
The different endings represent what you should do based on your stats. If you have a high gpa  and your stress level is high or your social level is low, you should relax and go have fun on break. If you have an average gpa and your scocial level and stress level are not too high but really low then you should pick whether or not you get an internship or go and hang out with some friends on break. If you have a low gpa and you didn't even really study this semster then you should be trying to better yourself academically on break so that you can hit the ground running once you get back. 

# Any AI assistance. 
AI didn't write my code but I did use it to debug and better understand why my code was wrong in some areas.
